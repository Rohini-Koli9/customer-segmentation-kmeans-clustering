# Customer Segmentation KMeans Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a powerful tool that helps businesses identify distinct customer groups based on their behavior and characteristics, enabling personalized marketing strategies and improved decision-making.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To segment customers into distinct groups using K-Means clustering.
- **Dataset**: Includes customer demographic and behavioral data (details in the notebook).
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Repository Structure
- `Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and implementation of K-Means clustering.
- `Mall_Customers.csv`:  containing the dataset used in the project.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/customer-segmentation-kmeans-clustering.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation-kmeans-clustering
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook to analyze the data and view the segmentation results.

## Key Steps in the Project
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand key features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and scaling the data for better clustering performance.
3. **Clustering**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to identify distinct customer segments.
4. **Visualization**: Using scatter plots and other visualizations to interpret the clusters.

## Results
The K-Means clustering algorithm successfully segments customers into meaningful groups. These clusters can be utilized for:
- Crafting targeted marketing campaigns.
- Delivering personalized recommendations.
- Enhancing customer retention strategies.
